/// will be be a value from `inputField`, but comes from the index that comes from `permutation` at
/// position _i_. The result is placed in `outputField`.

/// The intention of this method is to implement the mapping of fields from the input to the output
/// in filters (many of which require this permutation of a field), but can be used in other places
/// as well.

/// `outputField` is set to have the same metadata as the input. If the metadata needs to change
/// (such as the name or the association) that should be done after the function returns.

/// `true`, then the results in `outputField` are valid. If it is `false`, then `outputField`
/// should not be used.
///
/// If an invalid index is given in the permutation array (i.e. less than 0 or greater than the
/// size of the array), then the resulting outputField will be given `invalidValue` (converted as
/// best as possible to the correct data type).
