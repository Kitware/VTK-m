/// \brief Median algorithm for general image blur
///
/// The ImageMedian filter finds the median value for each pixel in an image.
/// Currently the algorithm has the following restrictions.
///   - Only supports a neighborhood of 5x5x1 or 3x3x1
///
/// This means that volumes are basically treated as an image stack
/// along the z axis
///
/// Default output field name is 'median'
