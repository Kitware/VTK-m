/// \brief Groups connected points that have the same field value.
///
/// The ImageConnectivity filter finds groups of points that have the same field value and are
/// connected together through their topology. Any point is considered to be connected to its Moore neighborhood:
/// 8 neighboring points for 2D and 27 neighboring points for 3D. As the name implies, `ImageConnectivity` only
/// works on data with a structured cell set. You will get an error if you use any other type of cell set.
///
/// The active field passed to the filter must be associated with the points.
///
/// The result of the filter is a point field of type `vtkm::Id`. Each entry in the point field will be a number that
/// identifies to which region it belongs. By default, this output point field is named "component"
/// (which can be changed with the `SetOutputFieldName` method).
